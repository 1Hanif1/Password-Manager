## How I built it

 I made this project for my college assignment.

 The frontend work was fairly simple as I am a bit well versed with it.

 But the backend was tough. I had to learn a lot of new things, do a lot of googling, debug a lot of issues to make it work. It is my first fullstack application.

I used mongodb since I got to know it uses JSON like format to store data and as someone with frontend experience it felt less intimidating to start.

Overall I had a lot of fun building this project
